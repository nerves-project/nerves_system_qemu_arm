## v1.0.0-rc.1

This release contains updates to Erlang and heart from `nerves_system_br` and
mostly cosmetic changes to this project. The trivial `.fw` files are no longer
created by CI scripts. If you've forked this project and are building systems
using CI, make sure to update your publish scripts.

  * Start running nerves_system_linter to check for configuration errors.
  * Automount the boot partition readonly at `/boot`

    See [Reverting Firmware](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves_runtime/readme.html#reverting-firmware) for more info on reverting firmware.

    See [fwup-revert.conf](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_rpi/blob/master/fwup-revert.conf) for more information on how fwup handles reverting.

  * [nerves_system_br v0.14.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v0.14.1)

## v0.13.0

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v0.14.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v0.14.0)
    * [Buildroot 2017.08](https://git.busybox.net/buildroot/plain/CHANGES?id=2017.08)
    * [fwup 0.17.0](https://github.com/fhunleth/fwup/releases/tag/v0.17.0)
    * [erlinit 1.2.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/erlinit/releases/tag/v1.2.0)
    * [nbtty 0.3.0](https://github.com/fhunleth/nbtty/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

* Enhancements
  * Add global patch directory

  This is required to pull in the e2fsprogs patch that's needed now that
  util-linux's uuid_generate function calls getrandom and can block
  indefinitely for the urandom pool to initialize

## v0.12.2

* Bug fixes
  * Hex package was missing the nerves.gen.qemu_script helper

## v0.12.1

The documentation has been completely updated to reflect the new way of
launching qemu. The old documentation has been retained since it contains so
much useful information. It can be found in the `old` directory.

* New features
  * Added the `mix nerves.gen.qemu_script` helper to create the starter shell
    script for running qemu

## v0.12.0

* New features
  * The application data partition is now `ext4`. This greatly improves its
    robustness to corruption. Nerves.Runtime contains code to initialize it on
    first boot.
  * Firmware images now contain metadata that can be queried at runtime (see
    Nerves.Runtime.KV
  * Firmware updates verify that they're updating the right target. If the target
    doesn't say that it's an `qemu` through the firmware metadata, the update
    will fail.
  * Added meta-misc and meta-vcs-identifier to the `fwup.conf` metadata for use
    by users and for the regression test framework
  * Added qt-webkit-kiosk

* Tool Dependencies
  * nerves_toolchain_arm_unknown_linux_gnueabihf 0.11.0
  * fwup 0.15.4
  * nerves_system_br v0.13.5
    * Buildroot 2017.05
    * Erlang/OTP 20.0

## v0.11.0

* New Features
  * Support for Nerves 0.5.0

## v0.10.0

* New features
  * Bump toolchain to use gcc 5.3 (previously using gcc 4.9.3)

## v0.9.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Loosen mistaken nerves dep on `0.4.0` to `~> 0.4.0`

## v0.9.0

This version switches to using the `nerves_package` compiler. This will
consolidate overall deps and compilers.

* Nerves.System.BR v0.8.1
  * Support for distillery
  * Support for nerves_package compiler

## v0.7.0

When upgrading to this version, be sure to review the updates to
nerves_defconfig. BR2_PACKAGE_ERLANG is no longer selected automatically and
must be added.

* nerves_system_br v0.7.0
  * Package updates
    * Buildroot 2016.08

  * Bug fixes
    * Many packages were removed. These include Elixir and LFE since neither are
      actually used. Both are added as part of the user build step, so no
      functionality is lost. The most visible result is that the system images
      are smaller and the test .fw file boots to the Erlang prompt.
    * Fix false positive from scrubber when checking executable formats due to
      C++ template instantiations. Ignores SYSV vs. GNU/Linux ABI difference.

## v0.6.1

* Package versions
  * Nerves.System.BR v0.6.1

* New features
  * Update docs/scripts on how to run qemu
  * Switch terminal output from video output to emulated serial port

## v0.6.0

* Nerves.System.BR v0.6.0
  * Package updates
    * Erlang OTP 19
    * Elixir 1.3.1
    * fwup 0.8.0
    * erlinit 0.7.3

  * Bug fixes
    * Synchronize file system kernel configs across all platforms

## v0.5.1

* Nerves.System.BR v0.5.1
  * Bug Fixes(nerves-env)
    * Added include paths to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
    * Pass sysroot to LDFLAGS

## v0.5.0

* Nerves.System.BR v0.5.0
  * New features
    * WiFi drivers enabled by default on RPi2 and RPi3
    * Include wireless regulatory database in Linux kernel by default
      on WiFi-enabled platforms. Since kernel/rootfs are read-only and
      coupled together for firmware updates, the normal CRDA/udev approach
      isn't necessary.
    * Upgraded the default BeagleBone Black kernel from 3.8 to 4.4.9. The
      standard BBB device tree overlays are included by default even though the
      upstream kernel patches no longer include them.
    * Change all fwup configurations from two step upgrades to one step
      upgrades. If you used the base fwup.conf files to upgrade, you no
      longer need to finalize the upgrade. If not, there's no change.

  * Bug fixes
    * syslinux fails to boot when compiled on some gcc 5 systems
    * Fixed regression when booting off eMMC on the BBB
